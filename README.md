We are excited to get to know you and your work better! See below for instructions on the Backend and Frontend code challenges. 

# Backend Code Challenge


### Introduction

The intent of this coding test is to assess your ability to work with requirements commonly seen at Reconstruction. We want you to display your knowledge of software design patterns and best practices.

There are a set of technologies that are core to our solutions so we would like for your implementation to make use of the following technologies:

- graphQL
- Typescript
- Serverless


### Description

Reconstruction offers two different plans for our users: Pay as You Go and Subscription. Pay as You Go users will pay a specific amount (starting at $100 generally) every time they enroll themselves in a unit. Subscription users pay a monthly rate of $49.97 to enroll in unlimited units. 

As part of our Subscription plan, we offer our users a 20% discount on all orders at the Reconstruction Store. Our store, which you can find on https://store.reconstruction.us/ sells SWAG products (t-shirts, hats, bottles, etc.). It is a Shopify store.

Any Subscribed user should be able to buy products at our store using this discount, which should be applied automatically to their order during checkout. They can use this discount as many times as they want, without an end date, as long as they have an active Subscription.

Reconstruction would like to restrict the automatic store discounts to users who are Subscribed to our Reconstruction platform. Users who are in a Pay as You Go plan should not receive the automatic discount. Our users are all identified through their email address.
